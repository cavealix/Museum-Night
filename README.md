### Versions Used
- [Unity LTS Release 2017.4.4](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2017.4)
- [GVR SDK for Unity v1.100.1](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases/tag/v1.100.1)


### About My Project
You will be doing research on VR companies/applications, or industries that could be impacted by VR and how. The intent of the research is to give you an opportunity to survey the VR landscape. We would like you to focus on VR applications (how VR is used) rather than the technology itself (how VR works). The goal is for you to acquire industry knowledge on your own and share it via the project.

After conducting your research, you will be creating a mobile virtual reality experience with 'information booths' which include both visual and audio feedback for users. These booths should showcase your findings - the goal here is to inform other people about the topic at hand in a fun and creative way through a series of (at least five) display points. Users should be able to travel back and forth between display areas inside the space. This is not a VR slideshow, it is a VR space which contains the information about your research. Some potential outputs of this project are creating a scene in a museum, science fair, or gallery-like space which showcases your findings.

Additionally, you will be reinforcing your learnings from the VR Design course by applying the same principles of user testing, iteration, and documentation, and include this write-up along with your project.

Why this project?
You learned a lot about VR platforms and applications, and we would like you to take this a step further by investigating VR companies/applications, or industries that could be impacted by VR and how. VR is in the early stages, and new development is happening every day. Learning how to stay abreast of the industry development and keep your eyes on the horizon of the future for VR will be critical for your career as a VR content creator.

### Instructions
For this project, we will only accept Cardboard with Unity submissions. Create a VR scene with navigation and instructions, which showcases the findings from your research. This could take the form of a gallery, a museum, or a more creative showcasing of the topics at hand. This scene should include at least 5 'display points' which educate viewers on the topic at hand. These display points can use VR objects, text, images, or video to convey the information at hand and must also emit relevant audio (either educational or complementary to the theme). Users should be able to freely navigate around the space to learn about the topic you have researched.

### Credits
The Cupix (https://www.cupix.com/) tour demo was used in leiu of my own since the mesh that was built using their service was unusable with major rifts in the mesh.
